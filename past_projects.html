                        <p>Cara’s wedding dress was the first wedding dress that I’d made. Bridal
                            wasn’t something that I was ever interested in doing and so it wasn’t something that I was
                            trying to pursue. But when my best friends’ older sister messaged me and asked if I would
                            make her wedding dress I was very excited by the idea of making something so special. </p>
                        <p>Cara’s dress was very simple yet had beautiful detail. Cara is a personal trainer so she
                            wanted something that would show off her athletic figure, but would still be comfortable.
                            Cara gave me a brief idea of what she wanted and I went ahead and did a few sketches for
                            her, we then met to discuss and decide on a final design. Cara showed me a few samples of
                            what she wanted and we combined that with my sketches.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the end she decided on a racerback style fitted satin dress that had a subtle fishtail. I
                            absolutely adore this dress and loved making it. We had several fittings and adjustments
                            during the months leading up to the wedding until we got it just right and Cara was happy
                            with the end product. </p>

                            <h5>The Details</h5>

                            <ul class="list mt-1">
                                <li>
                                    Full length racer back style, with 3 panels front and back satin cut on the bias for
                                    fit, stretch and comfort lined with a simple polyester stretch lining (the kind
                                    commonly
                                    used in swimwear).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    French lace from Franke Stuart in Hawthorn used to create a subtle fishtail with the
                                    scalloped edge just touching the floor.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Lace pieces’ hand appliqued from where the lace meets the satin of the fishtail up
                                    the dress to blend the lines. The lace was then used as an overlay for the bust with
                                    the scalloped edge meeting the waist which was all hand appliqued. My favourite part
                                    by far of this dress is the back detail, very low cut scoop and the racer back made
                                    just out of lace floating free from the satin, with the scalloped to finish. Held
                                    together with an invisible zip and hook & eye in the left side seam.

                        <p>Rosie was Cara’s only bridesmaid and sister. Rosie already knew exactly what she wanted so it
                            was easy for me to get the pattern started straight away. </p>
                        <p>Rosie’s dress fabric was also purchased from Franke Stuart in Hawthorn, it was made from
                            dusty rose raw silk and rose gold French lace. The dress was a very simple design consisting
                            of a full circle skirt with a triangle bikini style bodice that connected straight into the
                            waistband and tied together with bronze ribbons</p>
                        <p>I hand sewed delicate pale pink pearls all down the bodice which was overlayed with the
                            French lace as was the upper of the skirt. I had cut out the lace and hand appliquéd it on
                            to the silk so that it had a soft look.</p>

                                        following November. </p>

                                                Sophie wanted move of a vintage style dress, ivory lace and beige satin underneath.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Sophie is very easy going and didn’t feel the need to spend a lot on the fabric for
                                                the dress. We got lucky and found the perfect shade satin for $5 a meter, the tulle
                                                overlay for $8 a meter and the lining for $3 a meter. The lace however, her parents
                                                brought back from Vietnam and paid about $70 a meter for, which is still quite good.

                                            <li>
                                                I started by sitting down with Sophie and getting an idea of what she
                                                really wanted, we scoured through a selection of bridal magazines and
                                                flagged fabrics and styles that she liked.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                I then took these away and did a compile of sketches until we landed on
                                                a design that Sophie was really happy with. I started by making a calico
                                                toile and refining the fit from each try on until Sophie was happy with
                                                the fit. I then went on to use the toile as a pattern for the final
                                                fabric.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
            
                                    <div >
                                        <h5>The Details</h5>
                                        <ul class="list mt-1">
                                            <li>
                                                The final product was something I was extremely proud of and happy with.
                                                It was a full length flowing gown with a beautiful scalloped lace edge
                                                and lace detail coming up the skirt from the bottom and fading out
                                                towards the waistband. It had a light ‘v’ neck with sheer bell sleeves
                                                that I hand appliqued lace on to, to create the scalloped edge a fading
                                                lace. I also used small pieces of the lace to add an art deco detail to
                                                the shoulders of the dress to ties in with the lace on the skirt and
                                                sleeves.
